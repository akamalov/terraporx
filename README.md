# Portworx Terraform Examples

Portworx has a number of reference stacks that can be deployed through [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
These are available in the [Terraporx repo](https://github.com/portworx/terraporx)

The initial repository include examples for deploying Portworx across the following Providers:

* [AWS-EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
* [Packet.net](https://www.packet.net/)

The goal for the *Terraporx Repo* is to provide a community resource for sharing various Terraform configurations
that make it easier to deploy and manage Portworx.    If you see potential enhancements to the existing content, 
or would like to contribute your own, please feel free to submit issues or pull-requests against this repo.
This repo contains examples for how to deploy Portworx under Terraform
